  minecraft eula In order to protect Minecraft (our "Game") and the members of our community, we need these end user license terms to set out some rules for downloading and using our Game. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Mojang AB) and describes the terms and conditions for using the Game. We don't like reading license documents any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our Game. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.

If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement ("EULA") terms. If you don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or play our Game. This EULA incorporates the the terms of use for the mojang.com website ("Account Terms"), our brand and asset usage guidelines, and our our privacy policy. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully.
